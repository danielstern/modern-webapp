typescript-webapp
=================

A new take on the webapp template with typescript and angular built in

#Introduction
This is based on the popular HTML5 boilerplate but with several additions.

##Dependencies
- Grunt
- Less
- TypeScript
- Bower

##Differences from the original webapp
This app uses Typescript instead of Javascript. You can still use Javascript though, because Typescript is a superset of Javascript. However, a live-reload precompiler will warn you well in advance of any potential bugs. This app also opts for LESS instead of CSS. This app features a modern Bootstrap 3 implementation.

### Typescript
Typescript provides desperately needed support for typing and classes in Javascript. Anyone who has tried to build a large application, like a game, in Javascript, only to eventually feel it come tumbling down upon them like so many pieces of spaghetti, will immediately understand the benefits. 

- option to add strong typing for big projects
- active community
- don't have to use it - Javascript is valid Typescript

### LESS
LESS is a powerful alternative to just writing normal CSS.

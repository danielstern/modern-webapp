Modern Webapp
=================

Modern Webapp is a modern framework for making internet applications, taking advantage of many new frameworks with active communities to create a totally rethought programming experience. 

The focus of Modern Webapp is to use automated processes like Grunt to create a more advanced workflow.

## LESS + Typescript
These two languages are native to modern webapp. They make up the whole sizzling magic. They were both chosen for the same reasons,

## - Regular CSS is valid LESS, and regular Javascript are regular Typescript
## - Made for the web, by the web.

Both of these languages allow you to write in any environment where Grunt will automatically rebuild your project, refreshing the page, every time. 

### Full Sourcemap Support
This boilerplate takes full advantage of Chrome and Firefox's built in support for source maps. This makes editing LESS a snap.

### Bootstrap 3
Bootstrap 3 is totally awesome. By starting with this framework, responsive design becomes simple and easy. Take advantage of Bootstrap integration with LESS!

### Designed with Scalability in Mind
Typescript provides desperately needed support for typing and classes in Javascript. Anyone who has tried to build a large application, like a game, in Javascript, only to eventually feel it come tumbling down upon them like so many pieces of spaghetti, will immediately understand the benefits. 

CSS is potentially even more cumbersome and hard to maintain, and LESS is probably the best tool for combatting this by implementing LESS along with best practices from the very beginning.

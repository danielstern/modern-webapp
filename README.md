Modern Webapp
=================

A new take on the webapp template with typescript and angular built in

##Differences from the original webapp
This app uses Typescript instead of Javascript. You can still use Javascript though, because Typescript is a superset of Javascript. However, a live-reload precompiler will warn you well in advance of any potential bugs. This app also opts for LESS instead of CSS. This app features a modern Bootstrap 3 implementation.

### Typescript
Typescript provides desperately needed support for typing and classes in Javascript. Anyone who has tried to build a large application, like a game, in Javascript, only to eventually feel it come tumbling down upon them like so many pieces of spaghetti, will immediately understand the benefits. 

- **CLASSES!!!**
- option to add strong typing for big projects
- active community
- don't have to use it - Javascript is valid Typescript

### LESS
LESS is a powerful alternative to just writing normal CSS. It is backwards compatible with CSS but adds a useful precompiling step.

- Use mixins and stuff
- Nesting lets you isolate CSS and create a maintainable codebase
- NOT SASS. NO RUBY! HALLELUJAH! :dancers:

### Bootstrap 3
Our next framework needs no introduction at all. Works right out of the box on everything, and looks great.

- Responsive from the ground up
- So awesome
- Widely used and ideal for large and scalable projects
